	\n#This script scans for available Antennas and documents its findings\r\
	\n#in a file for the antenna_sitter script to pull from every 12 hours\r\
	\n#it will also declare failCount for antennaSitter to be able to manipulate it as a global variable\r\
	\n#This may create some interference if the fail count is at three say and the variable is reset. \r\
	\n#The likelihood of it happening is slim and will only result in the customer being down for an hour and 45 minutes\r\
	\n#instead of just an hour. \r\
	\n\r\
	\n#scans potential sectors without bringing the customer down\r\

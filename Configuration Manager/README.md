### Simply run main.py to gain functional insight as to what this project does. 

A predefined set of routerOS configurations are stored in configs/config_dictionary.json and configs/name_and_id.json to be grabbed later. in config_dictionary.json you will place all of the configurations you want to add as well as the variables the regex parser will be looking for in the .rsc file. Ensure the actual configuration script is saved somewhere in configs. Once you have chose a configuration and parsed out all of the variable it will ask you if you want to push to ITGlue as a configuration automatically. The configuration and company ID are interchangeable on this and can be altered for any combo. The script will print off the number of configs created and their names once the user exits the while loop.
